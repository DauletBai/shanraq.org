## üèõÔ∏è About the Project

In a world saturated with economic and political ratings, we often overlook the most crucial asset of any nation: its people. Shanraq.org was created to answer a simple question: which countries provide the best environment for nurturing talent?

We go beyond simple medal counts. Our unique methodology, the **Human Potential Index (HPI)**, analyzes international achievements in relation to a country's population. This approach allows us to see not just which nation won the most awards, but which nation is most effective at discovering, developing, and realizing the potential of its citizens.

### Core Concept: The HPI Formula

The index is calculated based on a weighted formula that values top achievements more highly. The result is then normalized by the country's population to provide a fair comparison.

`HPI = ((Gold * 3) + (Silver * 2) + (Bronze * 1)) / Population * 1,000,000`
