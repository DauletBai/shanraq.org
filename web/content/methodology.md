# Our Methodology: Calculating the Human Potential Index (HPI)

The Human Potential Index (HPI) is the core of our project. It is designed to provide a fair assessment of how effectively a country realizes the talents of its citizens on the international stage. The calculation is based on a transparent, weighted formula.
Step 1: Data Collection
Our automated bots systematically collect data from a curated list of official sources for major international competitions, olympiads, and awards across our key categories: Science & Technology, Sports, Arts & Culture, and Professional Skills. A full list of our data sources is available here.
Step 2: Weighted Points Calculation
To reflect the significance of different achievements, we assign weighted points for first, second, and third-place awards (or their equivalents):
•	Gold Medal / 1st Place: 3 points
•	Silver Medal / 2nd Place: 2 points
•	Bronze Medal / 3rd Place: 1 point
The total points for a country are calculated as:
Total Points = (Number of Gold * 3) + (Number of Silver * 2) + (Number of Bronze * 1)
Step 3: Index Calculation
To create a fair comparison between countries of vastly different sizes, we calculate the final index relative to the country's population. To make the resulting number easy to read, we calculate it as "points per 1,000,000 inhabitants."
The formula for the Human Potential Index is:
HPI = (Total Points / Population) * 1,000,000
This methodology allows us to identify countries that demonstrate outstanding results in human development, regardless of their population size.
