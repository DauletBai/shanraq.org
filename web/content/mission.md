# Our Mission

Our mission is to create a transparent and objective analytical tool that highlights the importance of investing in human capital. We believe that the progress of humanity is driven by talented and realized individuals, and the primary goal of any society should be to create an environment where every person can reach their full potential.
Our Core Principles:
•	Objectivity: We rely solely on publicly available data from official, reputable international competitions and awards. Our formula is transparent and applied equally to all countries.
•	Inclusivity: We strive to cover the broadest possible spectrum of human activity — from fundamental sciences and Olympic sports to the arts and modern professional skills.
•	Inspiration: By showcasing the countries that are most effective at nurturing talent, we hope to inspire governments, organizations, and societies to prioritize the development of human potential.
•	Global Unity: The name "Shanraq" symbolizes a common home for all humankind. Our project celebrates the achievements of every nation, viewing them as a collective contribution to the progress of our world.
