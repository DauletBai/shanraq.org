# About Shanraq.org

Welcome to Shanraq.org — a new analytical platform dedicated to exploring and measuring human potential across the globe.

In a world saturated with economic and political ratings, we often overlook the most crucial asset of any nation: its people. Every year, thousands of talented individuals from all corners of the planet showcase their abilities in science, sports, arts, and professional skills, winning prestigious awards and setting new benchmarks for humanity. But which countries provide the best environment for nurturing these talents?
Shanraq.org was created to answer this question. We go beyond simple medal counts. Our unique methodology, the Human Potential Index (HPI), analyzes international achievements in relation to a country's population. This approach allows us to see not just which nation won the most awards, but which nation is most effective at discovering, developing, and realizing the potential of its citizens.
Our project is a non-commercial, informational resource built on open data. We use sophisticated bots and AI to gather and analyze results from official sources, ensuring our ratings are objective, transparent, and up-to-date.
Join us in exploring a new dimension of global progress — one where the true wealth of a nation is measured by the achievements of its people.
